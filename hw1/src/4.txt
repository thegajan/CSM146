    Pclass)
        First class more people survived than not
        Second class about the same number survived as died (but more died)
        Third class much more people died than survived
        Ratio of dead:survive increased as class number increased
    Sex)
        Sex0 much more survived than died
        Sex1 much more died than survived
    Age)
        Most of the passengers were aged 20-40
        The only age range that had more survive than die was ages 0-10
        Otherwise, the ratio of dead:survived was only near or under 1 for those
        aged under 20 or over 50
    Sibsp)
        Those who had no siblings/spouse on board were much more likely to die
        If the unit size was too large, the member of the unit was likely to die
        as well
        Sweet spot for survival was having 1-2 siblings or spouse
    Parch)
        Again, like Sibsp, those with no parents/children or those with too many
        parents/children were the most likely to die
        Sweet spot for survival was having 1-3 parents/children
    Fare)
        Generally, the higher the fare you paid, the more likely it was that the
        passenger survived
    Embarked)
        Those who embarked from port0 were more likely to survive than note
        Both port1 and port2 embarkers had a high dead:survived ratio

b)  I obtained the correct training error of 0.485 as per the project spec. I notice that this error is higher than what is computed using the majority vote.

c)  The training error I got for the DecisionTreeClassifier is 0.014

d)  The training error I got for the KNeighborsClassifier for k = 3 is 0.167
    The training error I got for the KNeighborsClassifier for k = 5 is 0.201
    The training error I got for the KNeighborsClassifier for k = 7 is 0.240

e)  Below is the training and testing error of each of the classifiers
